            </div>
            <p class="intro">Welcome to the edge of the internet, fsociety — a place for ghosts, rebels, and digital phantoms. By entering this domain, you accept the following terms carved in the source.</p>

            <section class="rule">
                <h2><span class="icon">🧠</span> Rule #1: No Scripts. No Lazy Junk.</h2>
                <p>Leave your copy-paste garbage at the door. Scripts are banned — bring your own fresh, hand-crafted tools. We respect creativity. We worship originality.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule">
                <h2><span class="icon">🤝</span> Rule #2: No Shitty Fights, No Flex.</h2>
                <p>This isn’t a cage match — it's a brotherhood. No flaming, ego trips, or pointless beef. We're here to build, learn, and break stuff — together. You mess with the vibe, you're gone.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule">
                <h2><span class="icon">🕵️‍♂️</span> Rule #3: Do the Forbidden. Stay Invisible.</h2>
                <p>Yes — we do the illegal, the taboo, the unsanctioned. But rule #1 of being here: <b>STAY ANONYMOUS</b>. No real names. No personal drama. No bragging. Ghost in, ghost out.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="policy">
                <h3>🧩 fsociety’s Own Policies (yeah, we wrote these):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>🔒 Anonymity &gt; Everything:</b> We don’t track you. We don’t want your data. You screw that up? That's on you. Use a VPN. Use Tor. Use your brain.</li>
                    <li><b>🧬 Everyone is allowed:</b> We don't care about your age, just show the skills you have.</li>
                    <li><b>⛓ No Backdoors in Shared Tools:</b> Share what you want, but no hidden rats, loggers, or snitches. We scan and we expose.</li>
                    <li><b>🧼 Clean Posting Only:</b> This is a command center, not a circus. Post illegal things.</li>
                    <li><b>🕳 Respect the Underground:</b> Don’t link public, don’t name names, and NEVER invite outsiders.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="final">
                <h3>🧠 Final Line:</h3>
                <p>You’re not here to be famous. You’re not here to be liked. You’re here to disappear in the code — and leave no trace.</p>
            </section>

            <p class="last-warning">If you can’t follow these rules, shut the browser now. fsociety isn’t for tourists.</p>
