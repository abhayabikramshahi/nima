Welcome to the edge of the internet, fsociety — a place for ghosts, rebels, and digital phantoms.

1. No Scripts. No Lazy Junk.
   - Leave your copy-paste garbage at the door. Scripts are banned — bring your own fresh, hand-crafted tools.
   - We respect creativity. We worship originality.

2. No Shitty Fights, No Flex.
   - This isn’t a cage match — it's a brotherhood. No flaming, ego trips, or pointless beef.
   - We're here to build, learn, and break stuff — together. You mess with the vibe, you're gone.

3. Do the Forbidden. Stay Invisible.
   - Yes — we do the illegal, the taboo, the unsanctioned. But rule #1: STAY ANONYMOUS.
   - No real names. No personal drama. No bragging. Ghost in, ghost out.

4. fsociety’s Own Policies:
   - Anonymity > Everything: We don’t track you. We don’t want your data. Use a VPN. Use Tor. Use your brain.
   - Everyone is allowed: We don't care about your age, just show the skills you have.
   - No Backdoors in Shared Tools: Share what you want, but no hidden rats, loggers, or snitches. We scan and we expose.
   - Clean Posting Only: This is a command center, not a circus. Post illegal things.
   - Respect the Underground: Don’t link public, don’t name names, and NEVER invite outsiders.

Final Line:
   - You’re not here to be famous. You’re not here to be liked. You’re here to disappear in the code — and leave no trace.

If you can’t follow these rules, shut the browser now. fsociety isn’t for tourists.
